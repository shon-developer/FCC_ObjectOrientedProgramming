//? Change how weight is declared in the Bird function so it is a private variable. Then, create a method getWeight that returns the value of weight 15.

function Bird() {
  let weight = 15;
  this.getWeight = function () {
    return weight;
  };
}
let turkey = new Bird();
console.log(turkey.getWeight());
